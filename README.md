A python tool for PySulfSat.
Examples and documentation available at
https://PySulfsat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html



A preprint of a paper is available here: 10.31223/X5K360

If you have any issues with PySulfSat please raise an 'issue'. If you can attach your jupyter notebook and any associated files (spreadsheets), that makes it way easier to diagnose it. You can als
email these to penny_wieser@berkeley.edu

If you use PySulfSat in your paper, you must cite it (and you must also cite the original models you use):
e.g.
'calculations were performed in PySulfSat (Wieser and Gleeson 2023) using the SCSS model from Smythe et al. (2017), with an S6+ correction from Jugo et al. (2010).

Open-source software development practices do not currently align with the academic credit system. Thus, we plead that if you take large chunks of PySulfSat to incorperate in your own package which you publish in a peer review journal (>100 lines), you insist in your paper than in addition to citing your new package,
users also cite PySulfSat (or contact us to collaborate on the new package):

For example, people should write 'degassing was calculated in PyDegass (Smith et al. 2026), which relies on sulfate and sulfide solubility calculations from Wieser and Gleeson (2023).

 PySulfSat took >6 months to write, under the current academic credit system, if you simply repackage it with a few new features, I gain no traditional credit (citations)!

 Happy sulfur modelling
