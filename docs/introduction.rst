Introduction and Citation
==============================

Welcome to PySulfSat- An Open-Source python3 tool for calculating sulfide and sulfate solubility in magmas.

This tool is under review in Volcanica. You can currently cite the preprint: https://doi.org/10.31223/X5K360

==============================
Units
==============================

PySulfSat performs all calculations using  Kelvin for temperature and kbar for Pressure. Major element contents should be in wt%, all other units can be found in the doc strings of the relevant functions


==============================
Reporting bugs/issues with the code
==============================
No software is free of bugs, particularly when new features are being constantly added. We have extensively benchmarked PySulfSat to existing spreadsheets, and before the package is published on PyPI, automatic unit tests are run through GitHub in the attempt to catch problems introduced by changing Python dependencies/updates. However, if users spot any bugs, or wish to request features, they should submit an 'issue' on the GitHub page. Alternatively, they can email the author team. In both cases, please upload any files the code is using (e.g. excel, jupyter notebooks) so that I can run your code to see what the issue is!
